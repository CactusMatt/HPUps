<p class=MsoNormal>Lab 10:  Oral presentation of the results from one of the

<p class=MsoNormal>Final Exam</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Attendance is compulsory. Depending on enrollment, the class
is subdivided into groups of two or three students (&quot;partners&quot;) who
work together on the same experiments during the whole semester.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before starting a new experiment, (i) the written report on
the preceding experiment must be turned in, and (ii) you and your partner(s)
must pass pretest in the lab at the beginning of the lab period after the
lecture portion.  You are required to know how to carry out the experiment, the
principles of the apparatus you will be using, and the basic theory and
equations you will apply in calculating the results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before starting an experiment you will have to clean the
equipment, if necessary, and take inventory.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
measurements should be performed carefully and safely. Meticulous notes of the
primary data obtained should be kept in a notebook, individually by each
partner. Procedures actually followed should be described in your laboratory
notebook. Do not rely on  a summary  written  before  the  lab.   List lab
partners.   Include all experimental observations, data and calculations; you
may staple or tape in computer printouts and spectra.  If data is stored in
computer files accurately record the data file names and location.  Goggles 
and appropriate clothing (no sandals or shorts) must be worn at all times. 
Failure to wear safety goggles may result in ejection from lab and an F in the
course. In your notebook record a brief outline of the procedure you expect to
follow and construct two tables of information: 1) reagents; 2) equipment. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
the reagents table write the chemical name, chemical formula, a drawing of the
structure, the state in which it will be found (solid, liquid, gas, or in
solution), and hazard information from the Material Safety Data Sheet(s), which
will be available.  If solutions are to be prepared, calculate the amounts
needed and their concentrations. <br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Each
row in the equipment table should contain the property to be measured, the
equipment used for the measurement, and the sample(s) that will be measured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After finishing an experiment, you must clean all equipment
(including glassware) and have the instructor check their condition. Each
student is responsible for the equipment he/she is using. Breakage of equipment
should be reported immediately to the instructor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reports</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The part of an experiment involving calculation,
organization, and interpretation of the results must be the work of each
individual student and must show his/her understanding and competency.  
Violation of this rule may result in a zero score for the report.  The format
of this part of an experiment is the lab-report. A report should consist of
four sections:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction:
(~ ½ page) Brief description of the purpose of the experiment; include a
schematic drawing of the apparatus or material used. Specify the chemical
system investigated, date of experiment, lab partner(s) and title . <br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Experimental:
Presentation of the primary data in a logical sequence, taken from the notebook.
They must be reorganized and tabulated or plotted in graphical form, if
applicable. Specify what was measured (e.g., time, temperature, etc.).<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Calculations
and results: Presentation of the equations used. Also, include the most
important steps of your numerical calculations, and the computer program used
if any. Pay great attention to units and to significant figures. The final
result(s) should be reported as &quot;&lt;X&gt; ± s unit,&quot; and marked
conspicuously. Cite the source of numerical values of quantities if you took
them from the literature (author, title, publisher, place, date, page).<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>Give the uncertainties in the results:
Analysis of errors in the measured and derived data. Show quantitatively how
the uncertainties of your primary data affect the final results. Compare your
results with accepted values taken from the literature, and show the relative
error.  Cite the source of numerical values of quantities if you took them from
the literature (author, title, publisher, place, date, page).<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Draw
a conclusion.  Discuss the significance of the experimental results.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grades will be determined based on the following criteria:</p>
