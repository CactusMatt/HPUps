font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#003976'> is simply the <strong>chemistry</strong>
of the <strong>element carbon</strong>. No other element demonstrates the
versatility of the element carbon in chemical bonding. The one property unique
to carbon is that there seems to be no limit to the number of carbon atoms that
can be bonded to one another in a single molecule! Carbon is also unique in
that it can form stable multiple bonds between individual carbon atoms
(unlikely for the other elements of the carbon family).</span></p>

color:#003976'>The term <strong>organic</strong> originally meant substances
that are derived from living things but should no longer be confused with that
definitionâ€”It was once thought that carbon based compounds such as sugar, plant
oils, waxes, etc. could only come from living things and were given the name <strong>organic</strong>.
<strong>Inorganic</strong> was applied to substances such as rocks and minerals
and materials derived from them. However, with the first synthesis of urea in
the nineteenth century from ammonium cyanate(an <b>inorganic</b> compound), the
definition of <strong>organic</strong> had to be revised (formation of urea is
how ammonia, from the metabolism of amino acids, is stored in animals until
excreted). </span></p>

color:#003976'>The definition of organic chemistry is well established in
science, but in the common vernacular, the term <strong>organic</strong> still
is confusing especially in a conversation between a <strong>chemist</strong>
and a <strong>nonchemist</strong>. The term <strong>organic</strong> still
conveys the concept of <strong>natural, or living</strong> in the common
vernacular as opposed to <strong>man-made, artificial or synthetic.</strong>
However, water is natural but does not have any carbon. Therefore, in the
strictest scientific sense water is<b> inorganic</b>. Furthermore, <strong>Teflon</strong>
is a <strong>synthetic polymer</strong> used in various applications including
non-stick cookware, but <strong>teflon is an organic compound</strong> in the
scientific sense because it contains carbon. Many misunderstandings in the
world could be avoided if one's definitions were clearly outlined!</span></p>

color:#003976'>Organic chemistry is the chemistry of carbon compounds such as
pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals (fuels, gasoline, alcohols), foods, plastics,
polymers, textiles, adhesives, resins, dyes, proteins, and the nucleic acids.
Organic chemistry provides the chemical foundation for courses such as
biochemistry, polymers, molecular biology and other life sciences, and even
advanced inorganic chemistry. Mastery of organic chemistry is essential for
chemistry or biology majors wishing to pursue careers in the chemical industry,
science, science education, and the health or medical professions. As such,
this course is designed specially for these students, but make no mistake this
is a hard-core chemistry course. The course is not offered to meet the general
education requirements of the University. This course is challenging and
fast-paced in order to cover the material needed to provide students with
sufficient knowledge and expertise in organic chemistry to perform well on the
GRE, MCAT, ACS, and other exams. Whether we like it or not, graduate schools
and medical schools are interested in student performance in organic chemistry
and expect a certain base level of material to be covered in two semesters.</span></p>

color:#003976'>In the first semester (CHE 2331) the student is introduced to
the fascinating field of organic chemistry. We review the basic information
from general chemistry necessary for understanding organic chemistry such as
hybrid orbitals and equilibrium constants. Then we tackle nomenclature of the
alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alkyl halides and alcohols and the reactions each
can undergo (free-radical substitution, nucleophilic substitution, S<sub>N</sub>1
and S<sub>N</sub>2, and elimination reactions, E1 and E2, and oxidation of
alcohols).</span></p>

color:#003976'>The second semester (CHE 2341) is a continuation of the first
with an emphasis on spectroscopy (IR, MS, NMR, and UV), and multistep syntheses
involving further reactions of alcohols, electrophilic aromatic substitution,
nucleophilic aromatic substitution, carbonyl chemistry, amine chemistry, and
biological molecules, if time permits.</span></p>

color:#003976'>At Howard Payne University, the organic student receives the
same instruction that should be found in any organic classroom at any
university, but our classes are smaller allowing the student to receive
classroom instruction directly from a professor rather than a teaching
assistant. Also, the student has greater access to the professor outside of the
classroom than might be found at a larger university. </span></p>

color:#003976'>In the laboratory we emphasize <strong>green chemistry</strong>
wherever possible. We do not want a large portion of our budget going for waste
disposal. However, most of industrial chemistry is done on a large scale;
therefore, instead of simply decreasing the scale of the reaction to decrease
the waste, we have chosen most of our laboratories from sources emphasizing
either environmentally friendly reactants or environmentally friendly waste
products so that many experiments can be done larger than microscale. For
example, bleach can be used in the <strong>oxidation</strong> of some <strong>alcohols</strong>,
but the by-product is <strong>table salt</strong> that may be disposed in the
laboratory sink instead hauling to an expensive waste disposal facility. By law
the institution that produces any waste is responsible for that waste forever!
Therefore, it is preferable not to use reactions that produce any harmful
waste, wherever and whenever possible!</span></p>
